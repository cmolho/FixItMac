## Usage
On the home page, you will see the list of printers with red and green icons reflecting the status of the printers.

When you discover a problem with any of the printers, please click the corresponding printer to report.  This will lead you to the printer's profile page where you may select the specific problem that you are experiencing with the printer. To select one of the four issues, click the circle to the left of the printer issue. To write a description in the "other category", click on the placeholder text and type your printer problem. When finished selecting the issues the printer is experiencing, click the red report button. A pop-up box will ask you to confirm your report. Click "yes" to continue or "cancel" to return to the profile page. At any point you may return to the homepage by selecting the back button in the top left-hand corner of your screen.
