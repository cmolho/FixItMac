###Software Development, Spring 2016
FixItMac is a mobile application that helps students report problems that they are experiencing with a printer on campus in only a few clicks. It also serves to indicate which printers are in working-order and are available for use.
 * For more information, please email fixitmacalester@gmail.com
 * To access the full code of the application, visit the project page:
   https://github.com/cmolho/FixItMac
## Installation
TODO: Describe the installation process
## Usage
On the home page, you will see the list of printers with red and green icons reflecting the status of the printers. If the icons are red, it means the printer in that location is in the process of getting fixed. If the icon is green, it means that the printer is functioning correctly.  Each printer is categorized by its location and listed alphabetically by name.
To learn more about the application, click the information icon in the upper right hand corner of your screen. To go back to the home page, select the home button at the bottom of your screen.
When you discover a problem with any of the printers, please click the corresponding printer to report.  This will lead you to the printer's profile page where you may select the specific problem that you are experiencing with the printer. To select one of the four issues, click the circle to the left of the printer issue. To write a description in the "other category", click on the placeholder text and type your printer problem. When finished selecting the issues the printer is experiencing, click the red report button. A pop-up box will ask you to confirm your report. Click "yes" to continue or "cancel" to return to the profile page. At any point you may return to the homepage by selecting the back button in the top left-hand corner of your screen. Once you have reported a printer issue, you will be taken to a "thank you" page. Click the home icon at the bottom of the page to return to the main screen.
